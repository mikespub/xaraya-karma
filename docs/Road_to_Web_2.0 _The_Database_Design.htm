        <h2>
            Road to Web 2.0: The Database Design        </h2>
        <p>This
is the first of a continuing series of articles that explore making a
Web 2.0 application. The concepts are easy to put to use, and aren't
that much different (in my opinion) of normal web architecture. In this
series of articles I will be exploring my design and development a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080723091458/http://com.pendio.us/">Web 2.0 application</a>.
In this first article I will be discussing the initial database design
of com.pendio.us for insight on the choices that I have made for a new
style of discussion board. While I am still actively developing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080723091458/http://com.pendio.us/">com.pendio.us</a>,
(it is still rather buggy, but that is to be expected for a week old
project) I thought it might be fun to discuss some of my design choices
as a longer tutorial style entry. I will only be discussing the design
of the actual application, please note that I am using several tools to
speed my development:</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080723091458/http://www.xaraya.com/">Xaraya</a>
is used as my rapid application development platform. It is written in
PHP and uses multiple Databases for it's back end. I believe most of
the concepts that I will be exploring could easily be ported to other
platforms, but Xaraya is the one that I am comfortable with. Any
platform that gives you direct access to the output layer should work
just fine. I needed something that would also send back my AJAX request
in XML without a ton of work, and Xaraya fits the bill. For those that
have never used Xaraya, there will be a learning curve for development,
but the end time savings are considerable.</p>
<p>Just a note about Xaraya and this application that I have written,
Xaraya offers many &#8220;hooks&#8221; that I could have used to save me even more
time. I decided to write a completely stand alone application and thus
I did not take as much advantage as I could have of the platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080723091458/http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>
is being used as my Javascript library. There are many out there, but
Prototype seems to be the best documented. In addition, there are many
other libraries (as found on their main page) which build on top of
Prototype for some amazing features.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080723091458/http://www.mysql.com/">MySql</a> is being used as my back end.  I considered using <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080723091458/http://www.postgresql.org/">PostGreSQL</a>, as Xaraya supports both, but I am more familiar (right or wrong) with MySQL.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider when designing a database is what do you
want to do with your application? Thinking Web 2.0 doesn't add anything
to that basic concept. Here is what I wanted to do with com.pendio.us:</p>
<p>A forum that  free style tags instead of the traditional static category system.<br>
A configurable tag cloud tag that would take more into account than just hits to a tag.<br>
Posts that could be assigned to any or multiple tags.<br>
User Karma that would also play into the tag cloud consideration.<br>
Standard forum functions such as post count, subscriptions, bbcode, signatures, etc.<br>
Better SEO than traditional forums<br>
Expansion of future features with minimum database changes<br>
Post Voting<br>
Mailing list options.<br>
User configuration</p>
<p>Relatively simple, and pretty easy to picture. Basically, I want to
combine tags, posts, and users together to determine the popularity of
discussions. Looking at my initial specifications, I really only have
to store a few text type items and everything else will be integers for
look-ups. </p>
<p>For tags, I need to store the tag name, but what else needs to be
stored when thinking of a top level of my forum? I probably want to
store the time the tag was created to add to the cloud bonus for fresh
posts. I probably also need to know when the last post was created for
comparisons against other users fields for the &#8220;new&#8221; icons. If I want
standard forum features such as locked, sticky, etc type of tags, then
I am going to need a status field. I also might want to save the user
that created the original tag for easier look ups. Finally, I want to
save the cloud count for the tag itself. My database picture comes
relatively clear with these things in mind:</p>
<p><textarea name="code" class="sql">#
# Table structure for table `xar_ctags`
#
CREATE TABLE xar_ctags (
  xar_id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  xar_tag varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  xar_timestamp int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_lastpost int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_status tinyint(4) NOT NULL default '1',
  xar_uid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_count int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_options text,
  PRIMARY KEY  (xar_id),
  KEY i_xar_ctag_tags (xar_tag),
  KEY i_xar_ctag_timestamp (xar_timestamp),
  KEY i_xar_ctag_lastvisit (xar_lastvisit),
  KEY i_xar_ctag_status (xar_status),
  KEY i_xar_ctag_uid (xar_uid),
  KEY i_xar_ctag_count (xar_count)
) TYPE=MyISAM;</textarea><br>
I have a single varchar field to store the tag name. I can't imagine
every wanting a tag name to be bigger than 255 characters, therefore I
am using var characters. I think as tags as titles not as actual text.
The only thing that I did not mention in my thought process was the
options. <br>
You will see in all three of my major tables, I host an 'options'
field. I am using this field for future expansion. It is awfully easy
to store a serialized array in a table for later processing. It does
affect performance just a bit, but for those brilliant, AHA! Moments
that you have at two o'clock in the morning, it is a easy compromise to
make. The one change that I should have made in this table structure
was to use tagid instead of id for the primary key name. While I am
using tagid throughout my code, this would have simplified my comments
just a bit.</p>
<p>For my posts, the thought process was very much the same. I need to
be able to capture the text that a user writes first and foremost. In
addition, I want to collect information such as the time of the post
and who made the post. In addition, like any other forum application, I
want to be able to give it a status such as a sticky post or maybe even
promote that post to the top of the tag. Finally, I do want to keep
post count information to calculate karma for my users. Pretty simple
when you think about this design:<br>
<textarea name="code" class="sql">#
# Table structure for table `xar_cposts`
#
CREATE TABLE xar_cposts (
  xar_postid int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  xar_timestamp int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_uid mediumint(9) NOT NULL default '1',
  xar_text text,
  xar_status tinyint(4) NOT NULL default '1',
  xar_count int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_options text,
  PRIMARY KEY  (xar_postid),
  KEY i_xar_cposts_pid (xar_postid),
  KEY i_xar_cposts_status (xar_status),
  KEY i_xar_cposts_uid (xar_uid),
  KEY i_xar_cposts_count (xar_count),
  FULLTEXT KEY xar_text (xar_text)
) TYPE=MyISAM;</textarea><br>
My last major sub-system that I am going to have to write for my
application is the user data. The majority of my user information is
covered by Xaraya, but there is some information that I want to be
specific to my application. I want to capture Karma based on my forum.
So, I need to know how many tags and posts a user has created. In
addition, I want to know when the last time a user created something.
Finally, what is the karma information in the end after another user
&#8220;votes&#8221; for you?</p>
<p>This was the most simple of all the tables:<br>
<textarea name="code" class="sql">#
# Table structure for table `xar_cusers`
#
CREATE TABLE xar_cusers (
  xar_uid int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  xar_tagcount int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_postcount int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_timestamp int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_options text,
  PRIMARY KEY  (xar_uid),
  KEY i_xar_cusers_tagcount (xar_tagcount),
  KEY i_xar_cusers_postcount (xar_postcount),
  KEY i_xar_cusers_timestamp (xar_timestamp)
) TYPE=MyISAM;
</textarea></p>
<p>So, now I have my major sub-systems defined. I also need some glue
to hold them all together. The easiest way to do this is to create a
series of look up tables that can cover how the tables will interact.
Once you have the major systems and the look-ups, it is a piece of cake
to do a left-join on these tables to extract the meaningful information
that my application needs. </p>
<p>With that in mind, what glue do I need? Well, I need to know what
post belongs to what tag. Whenever a post is created, I just need to
update my look-up table to say, 'hey, this post is associated to these
tags'. My look-up table is incredibly simple with that in mind:<br>
<textarea name="code" class="sql">#
# Table structure for table `xar_clook`
#
CREATE TABLE xar_clook (
  xar_tagid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_postid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  KEY i_xar_clook_tagid (xar_tagid),
  KEY i_xar_clook_postid (xar_postid)
) TYPE=MyISAM;
</textarea><br>
I am saving the tagid and the postid.  Since both of these are indexed, I should be able to quickly look-up on my joins.</p>
<p>Next, I need to figure out who is subscribed to what tag so I can
separate these subscriptions from the cattle. Well, if I am looking for
subscriptions then I am basically assigning a user to my tag and thus
my look-up would be something like this:<br>
<textarea name="code" class="sql">#
# Table structure for table `xar_csubs`
#
CREATE TABLE xar_csubs (
  xar_tagid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_uid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  KEY i_xar_csubs_tagid (xar_tagid),
  KEY i_xar_csubs_uid (xar_uid)
) TYPE=MyISAM;
</textarea><br>
Once again, incredibly simple look up table, but I have associated a
user with my tag. Now, I can say, 'hey, I like this conversation, let
me save it for quicker access'.</p>
<p>Finally, no forum would be complete without letting you know
something has been updated on your next visit. Thinking about this, I
need to know who and what tag. I also need to have some times to
compare. In my tag table, I have my last post time stamp. I also have
various timestamps on each of my various subsystems, but nothing that
compared when a visitor visited an individual tag. So, I need to make a
field for quick access to that information.<br>
<textarea name="code" class="sql">#
# Table structure for table `xar_cuvisit`
#
CREATE TABLE xar_cuvisit (
  xar_tagid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_uid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  xar_timestamp int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
  KEY i_xar_cuvisit_tagid (xar_tagid),
  KEY i_xar_cuvisit_uid (xar_uid)
) TYPE=MyISAM;
</textarea><br>
Now, I have something that I can see that user &#8220;x&#8221; visited tag &#8220;x&#8221; at
this time. I have something that I can compare the timestamp in my tag
field against on a user by user basis. I thought about doing this as a
session var or even a cookie, as this table will grow substantially
with more usage. I may still go back to that idea, but I felt that I
also wanted the information for later use as well. With that in mind, I
will probably purge this table of visits over &#8220;x&#8221; weeks old, thus
keeping the size to sane levels.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is my design for this database. Thinking about
this a bit, I have managed to get myself into a Web 2.0 mindset without
really deviating from normal DB design. I have tags, karma, tag clouds
all with a traditional system of updating and monitoring.</p>
<p>Next series up is how we access these fields from our standard API with extremely flexible SQL queries.</p>
